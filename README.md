# Computer Vision Learning Repository

This repository is a structured collection of practice work created to develop a strong foundation in computer vision and real-time visual computing.  
It focuses on learning how visual data from cameras can be processed, interpreted, and mapped to meaningful actions using modern computer vision techniques.

The work in this repository emphasizes hands-on experimentation, problem-solving, and understanding the end-to-end pipeline of real-time vision systems, from data acquisition to interactive output.

## Learning Focus Areas
- Fundamentals of computer vision using Python
- Real-time image and video processing
- Human–computer interaction through visual cues
- Gesture-based control mechanisms
- Integration of vision models with system-level actions


## Objective
The objective of this repository is to build practical understanding through implementation-driven learning.  
It serves as a learning resource and reference for experimenting with interactive computer vision concepts and building a foundation for more advanced vision-based applications.
